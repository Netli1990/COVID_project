# COVID_project
Exploratory data analysis.
Completed by Nataliia Tyshchenko.
This analysis was done for my first project completed as a part of Google Data Analytics Certificate.
The goal of the analysis is to investigate the state of COVID in Australia and the world in general, check the effect of vaccination on the spread of the virus.
The data I am using can be found [here](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).
After downloading the dataset I have split it into two tables to show the use of JOINS later in my SQL code.
The vizualizations for this analyis were created in Tableau Public and summorized in [this dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nataliia.tyshchenko/viz/Project1_16818979357000/Dashboard1#2)
Key findings:
- Total of 762,588,872 COVID infection cases have been registered worldwide.
  Total death count is 6,895,830, meaning that mortality rate is 0.9%. 
- First graph shows the countries with the highest death rate. 
  In Yemen, for example, 18% of all COVID cases are lethal. This rate is much higher to the rest of the world.
  This can be explained by poor state of healthcare system.
  But there is also a possibility that not all infection cases are registered, incorrectly driving the death rate up.
- Bubble chart shows us the countries with the highest death count with the USA losing 1,121,237 lives to COVID by the beginning of April 2023.
- Side by side graph compares infection rates in Australia to Europe and United States. 
  It clearly shows how infection rate in Australia jumps to over 40% in 2022 in comparison to less than 2% in 2021.
  It can be connected to the end of lockdown measures at the end of 2021. And show the effectiveness of those measures on keeping the virus contained.
- Graph number 4 shows the correlation of vaccination rates in Australia to COVID death rates. 
  It shows how with the vaccination rate going up to over 80% in the beginning of 2022, death rate droped down to less than 0.3%. 
  We can argue that the chance of dying from COVID in Australia in lower than the worldwide average.
- Next we can look at the map that shows us the vaccination rates in different countries.
- I have tried to check if it correlates to infection rates in 2023, and see if vaccination effects the spread of the virus. 
  Unfortunately, a lot of countries show 0% infection rate. 
  This leads me to a conclusion that the data is incomplete, making the last step of the analysis impossible to execute at this stage.
